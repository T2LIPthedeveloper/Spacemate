# Spacemate

This is the app repo for __Spacemate__, our space-booking app for SUTD, developed by a team of 6 individuals for the 50.001 Information System and Programming .

Languages used: *Java, JSON (via GSON)*

External utilities used: *Google Firebase (Firestore and Firebase Authentication)*

## App Functionality ##

This app serves as a space-booking application for locations in SUTD. The app was pilot-tested using the space in front of the Albert Hong Lecture Theatre, allowing for table bookings in advance at any time of day. 

Using the app, the users can:
- book any available table at any time of day.
- see the availability of seats or tables in a location using capacity indicators.
- bookmark their favourite locations for quick access.
