## App Functionality

This app serves as a space-booking application for locations in SUTD. The app was pilot-tested using the space in front of the Albert Hong Lecture Theatre, allowing for table bookings in advance at any time of day.

Using the app, users can:
- Book any available table at any time of day.
- See the availability of seats or tables in a location using capacity indicators.
- Bookmark their favourite locations for quick access.
